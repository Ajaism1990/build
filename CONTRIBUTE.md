##How to file a bug

PhoneGap Build bugs are tracked in the issue list on GetSatisfaction. Always search for existing issues before filing a new one (use the search field at the top of the page).

When filing a new bug, please remember to include:

- A helpful title - use descriptive keywords in the title and body so others can find your bug (avoiding duplicates).
- Steps to reproduce the problem, with actual vs. expected results
- OS & PhoneGap Build version
- Screenshots are very helpful if you're seeing an error message or a UI display problem. (Just drag an image into the issue description field to include it).
    
##How to file a bug about a 3rd party plug-in
There has been great adoption of usage of the new 3rd party plug-in feature since its introduction on PGB.  Dozens of plug-ins were submitted for approval, posting, and ultimate usage by our complete user base.    Please keep in mind that these plug-ins, although hosted on the Adobe build.phonegap.com site, are the responsibility of the plug-in authors.  Hence, questions with the plug-ins should be directed to the plug-in authors and not the Adobe PhoneGap Build team.
